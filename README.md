## Exercise-1

**Design Patterns**
This repository contains Java implementations of various design patterns, including the Structural, Creational and Behavioural design pattern. These design patterns are fundamental to creating robust and maintainable object-oriented software.

## Table of Contents

**Design Patterns:**
- Factory Pattern
- Singleton Pattern
- Adapter Pattern
- Decorator Pattern
- Observer Pattern
- Strategy Pattern

## Compilation

To compile the Java files, you need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. You can download the JDK from the official Oracle website or use a package manager for your operating system.

Once JDK is installed, follow these steps to compile the files:

Open a terminal or command prompt

Navigate to the directory containing the Java files:
- cd /path/to/src

Compile the Java files using the javac command:
- javac file_name.java

Run the Java files using java command:
- java file_name

## Exercise-2

Once JDK is installed, follow these steps to compile the files:

Open a terminal or command prompt

Navigate to the directory containing the Java files:
- cd /path/to/src

Compile the Java files using the javac command:
- javac *.java

**Ensure that (*) is been placed before .java**

Run the Java files using java command:
- java VirtualClassroomManager

Make sure to replace /path/to/src with the actual path to your src directory.
